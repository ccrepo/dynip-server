# Project: dynip-sever

Project dynip-server is an example java Servlet to demonstrate the use of asymmetric RSA keys.

This program works in concert with dynip-client and dynip-query.

You can use a browser to query dynip-server as follows: 

Set host, port and protocol as appropriate.
    
        <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/ipserver/server/ip/query
    
e.g.
    
        https://localhost/ipserver/server/ip/query

or

        http://localhost:8080/ipserver/server/ip/query
